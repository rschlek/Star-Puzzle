Start the server in class "StarbServer" and run "StarbClient." 
In the GUI window, click start new puzzle. In our puzzle, 10x10, each row, column, and bolded region
must contain 2 stars each, and stars must not be
adjacent to eachother (including diagonally). To play the game, you 
mouse click once for a star, twice for a dot, and 3 times
to clear the space. The dots are used to mark off places that
a star cannot be. Once you get the correct solution for the puzzle,
the background will turn green indicating you have solved it,
and you can click the button "start new puzzle" to
load another puzzle to solve.
